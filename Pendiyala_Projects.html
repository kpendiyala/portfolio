          <h4> Synopsis of Project </h4>
            <p>
             This was a project where my team and I coded a discord bot that casually interacted with users on its server. In this prototype, we 
             focused on giving people motivational advice through  stress-relieving games and motivational videos based on search queries. Our 
             bot had 3 main functionalities: Stalker, Game, and Query. The Stalker functionality occurred when the discord bot randomly interjected within 
             conversations and provided relevant information based on the subject being discussed. For example, if two users were talking about Lebron James,
             our bot would interject the conversation with information about Lebron James because it identified him as the subject of the discussion. The next
             functionality is the game functionality, where the user can play a simple game of tic-tac-toe with the bot; this is triggered by the command “!play”.
             And finally, when asked a question, Miles will process it and output links to the three most relevant youtube and google search results. This 
             functionality is triggered through the command “Hey Miles,” followed by the specific question/query. The walkthrough of the functionalities oof the bot can be found in this <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/198rcQTXTp193BKUFNjiXfUpYgJg9cvDJ/view?usp=sharing">video</a>. In this project, my specific role was to work 
             on the query functionality of our bot as well as the <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJfl1d_f4bqGF9LvideydcbJ9ikNNdcTYvFG8FCUaVE/edit">documentation</a> and <a href= "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15MAVA8vK3ajSBl8I7ADx1qaIlvQRNfEbQCrA3sI03kk/edit#slide=id.gbb9d1132cc_0_5">presentation</a>. Throughout this project, we implemented various libraries such 
             as spaCy, scrapy, and discord.py. Initially, I was very confused because we worked with Python, which was a language I was not familiar with. However,
             with the help of my teammates and the internet, I was able to implement different libraries in our bot. An important lesson that I learned from this 
             project was the importance of teamwork and perseverance. Even though I didnt understand the language at first, I did a lot of research on the topic 
             and familiarized myself with it. In addition, because I was new to Python, my team and I had to find an efficient way to delegate tasks. We decided 
             that Akash and I would focus on the presentation and documentation aspect of the project, while Kaif worked on the code. Overall, this project taught
             me many important skills regarding perseverance and teamwork.

            <p>
            In this project, my partner and I were prompted to create a portrait for a family picture that 
            included various customizable parameters. We decided to include rounded edges, a border,  greyscale,
            a logo, and text in our customizable family portrait. Throughout the creation of our portrait, Jericho 
            and I communicated with each other effectively in order to make sure that both of us understood all parts 
            of our code. Whenever I had a question, Jericho would explain it to me in detail, making sure I fully comprehended 
            the code before moving on. This way, both of us understood what each line of code does in our program, 
            consequently deepening our knowledge on image manipulation. We also worked on the <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QMORFjnG5kOjllaa5RHweaUIKyPPFiSNniLRRR0MCzk/edit">documentation</a>
            of our project, which explained our code and displayed all our images in a concise, effortless way. Even with the communication 
            between Jericho and I, we still encountered some problems that we were not able to solve ourselves. In order to 
            solve these problems, we had to turn to other <a href= "https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html">reference documents</a> 
            on the internet and learn from these sources. By combining our prior knowledge on PIL with our teamwork, we were able to 
            find solutions to most of our problems regarding the code quickly and effortlessly. Overall, this was a very fun and fascinating project in which both 
            Jericho and I used our teamwork and self-learning skills to create a customizable family portrait that the user would love.

            <p>
             In this project, my partners and I created an educational game that has multiple levels represented by an era in human civilization.
             For example, the first level would be the bronze age, the second level would be the stone age, the third level would be the iron age,
             and so on and so forth. To progress to the next level, the user would have to complete a set of history themed trivia minigames. In these
             minigames, the user would have to answer a set of questions before bears attack your villiage and deplete your health bar. If you sucessfully
             complete the mini-game, you would move on to the next level but if you didnt, you would have to restart the game. This 
             <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nqUyLqE4YohyxgViNV6n44rusGgmMHpM/view">video</a> walks through the functionality of the game
             and the game can be viewed and played <a href= "https://github.com/LoneKampfer/U1Project-CivilizationBuilder">here.</a>
             However, we still encountered some problems regarding responsibilities for group members. A lot of us could not meet at the same time, so we 
             delegated tasks to each person and worked on it offline for some of the project. When we got together, we discussed what we did and clarified any 
             questions we had. In addition, we had to do research to implement some of the features that were more complex. My specific role in this project was
             to asssist and delegate tasks to everyone on their parts while doing my own. I helped mainly with the implementation of the questions into the 
             minigame and helped my parters with their work too. I took the initiative with the coding and developed a lot of leadership skills throughout this
             project.

            <p>
             In this project, my partners and I created a natural selection simulation using snakes as our example. We had 2 types of snakes, one was blue and 
             one was green. Because our background was green, the green snakes had an advantage over the blue snakes because they could camouflage better in the
             surroundings. We implemented a reproduction feature in which each snake had a probability to reproduce with their own species when they touched. We also
             introduced a predator (an eagle) to simulate natural selection. Because the green snakes could camouflage better in the surroundings, they had a less
             probability of being eaten than the blue snakes. Over time, we observed that the blue snakes went extinct while the green snakes were thriving and overpopulating. 
             This <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wgOzlEu-wPNKEUd6Unz5tsh-KZfsXGVV/view">video</a> walks through our simulation in detail and goes over the code
             and you can access our code and play the simulation youself through <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ho6yy1hgR921ieAbC7v9MvPxSi3nl_F8/view">here.</a>
             This was our first project using Greenfoot, so we had trouble using the interface. We had to do a lot of research on the Greenfoot interface and learn about
             Greenfoot as we progressed through the project. Another problem that we encountered was that our whole program broke when we were writing our predator method.
             To fix this, we re-wrote the predator method and took a different approach that was more feasible and through this experience, we developed good coding practices.
             This was a project that everyone was very passionate about, as we got together everyday and worked on it resiliently. In this project, my role was the leader because
             I got the group together and decided on the basis of our game while delegating tasks to my group members. Many of the features in our game were suggested by different 
             people and everything we did was a collective effort. Overall, this was a very fun and interesting project where I learned many important lessons regarding leadership
             and self-resilience.
