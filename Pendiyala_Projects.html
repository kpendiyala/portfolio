          <h4> Synopsis of Project </h4>
            <p>
             This was a project in which my partner, Siri Praneedra, and I coded an interactive, thrilling murder mystery. As a well known detective, the users job 
             is to figure out who robbed the bank the night before. The user is left with a set of clues, each leading them down a different path, eventually 
             determining if they will catch the criminal or not. My role in this project was mainly to focus on the coding, as well as contributing ideas for our game.
             My partner, Siri, focused on the documentation of our project 
             <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZjlhpNSmw0VOD4NwX3GTVX2PioD11YPYCVEPSPG2gU/edit">(Click here)</a>, which explained every decision we made 
             throughout the development of our game. Although there were many problems that we encountered throughout our project, Siri and I used teamwork to solve 
             them. Siri and I worked very well as a team, as we both implemented new ideas and were open to suggestions. One significant obstacle that we encountered 
             was when our Scratch game code broke just as we were nearing the deadline. Siri and I used teamwork to solve this problem, as she handed out suggestions 
             for what might be wrong, while I fixed the code to test for different problems. We soon found the problem and fixed it effortlessly because of our 
             teamwork and resilience.
