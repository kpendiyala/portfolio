          <h4> Synopsis of Project </h4>
            <p>
             This was a project in which my partner, Siri Phaneendra, and I coded an interactive, thrilling murder mystery. As a well known detective, the users job 
             is to figure out who robbed the bank the night before. The user is left with a set of clues, each leading them down a different path, eventually 
             determining if they will catch the criminal or not. My role in this project was mainly to focus on the coding, as well as contributing ideas for our game.
             My partner, Siri, focused on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZjlhpNSmw0VOD4NwX3GTVX2PioD11YPYCVEPSPG2gU/edit" target="_blank">documentation</a>
             of our project, which explained every decision we made  throughout the development of our game. Although there were many problems that we encountered
             throughout our project, Siri and I used teamwork to solve them. Siri and I worked very well as a team, as we both implemented new ideas 
             and were open to suggestions. One significant obstacle that we encountered was when our Scratch game code broke just as we were nearing the
             deadline. Siri and I used teamwork to solve this problem, as she handed out suggestions for what might be wrong, while I fixed the code to
             test for different problems. We soon found the problem and fixed it effortlessly because of our teamwork and resilience.

            <p>
            In this project, my partner and I were prompted to create a portrait for a family picture that 
            included various customizable parameters. We decided to include rounded edges, a border,  greyscale,
            a logo, and text in our customizable family portrait. Throughout the creation of our portrait, Jericho 
            and I communicated with each other effectively in order to make sure that both of us understood all parts 
            of our code. Whenever I had a question, Jericho would explain it to me in detail, making sure I fully comprehended 
            the code before moving on. This way, both of us understood what each line of code does in our program, 
            consequently deepening our knowledge on image manipulation. We also worked on the <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QMORFjnG5kOjllaa5RHweaUIKyPPFiSNniLRRR0MCzk/edit">documentation</a>
            of our project, which explained our code and displayed all our images in a concise, effortless way. Even with the communication 
            between Jericho and I, we still encountered some problems that we were not able to solve ourselves. In order to 
            solve these problems, we had to turn to other <a href= "https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html">reference documents</a> 
            on the internet and learn from these sources. By combining our prior knowledge on PIL with our teamwork, we were able to 
            find solutions to most of our problems regarding the code quickly and effortlessly. Overall, this was a very fun and fascinating project in which both 
            Jericho and I used our teamwork and self-learning skills to create a customizable family portrait that the user would love.

            <p>
             In this project, my partners and I created an educational game that has multiple levels represented by an era in human civilization.
             For example, the first level would be the bronze age, the second level would be the stone age, the third level would be the iron age,
             and so on and so forth. To progress to the next level, the user would have to complete a set of history themed trivia minigames. In these
             minigames, the user would have to answer a set of questions before bears attack your villiage and deplete your health bar. If you sucessfully
             complete the mini-game, you would move on to the next level but if you didnt, you would have to restart the game. This 
             <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nqUyLqE4YohyxgViNV6n44rusGgmMHpM/view">video</a> walks through the functionality of the game
             and the game can be viewed and played <a href= "https://github.com/LoneKampfer/U1Project-CivilizationBuilder">here.</a>
             However, we still encountered some problems regarding responsibilities for group members. A lot of could not meet at the same time, so we 
             delegated tasks to each person and worked on it offline for some of the project. When we got together, we discussed what we did and clarified any 
             questions we had. In addition, we had to do research to implement some of the features that were a more complex. My specific role in this project was
             to asssist and delegate tasks to everyone on their parts while doing my own. I helped mainly with the implementatioon of the questions into the 
             minigame and helped my parters with their work too. I took the initiative with the coding and developed a lot of leadership skills throughout this
             project.
