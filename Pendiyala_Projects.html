          <p>
           This was a project that I worked with Siri Phaneendra. The objective of this game was to allow the reader to choose between various choices
           in order to reach the objective of the game, which was to find out who had robbed the bank earlier that night. The reader ahs plenty of options
           to choose from, each leading them down a different path. My role in this project was mainly to focus on the coding, as well as contributing ideas
           for our game. My partner, Siri, focused on the documentation of our project 
           <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PfbDqGTaDnrM9C22oO60yNXuDOk7RdtAdZdoagNf3bg/edit">(Click here)</a>, which explained every decesion 
           that we made to get to our final game. Although there were many probles that we encountered throughut our project, Siri and I used teamwork to
           solve them. As we were nearing the deadline for our project, our Scratch game code broke and we were so close to the final version. Siri and I used
           teamwork to solve this problem, as she handed out suggestions for what might be wrong, while I fixed the code. We soon found our problem and fixed it
           effortlessly because of our teamwork and resiliance
