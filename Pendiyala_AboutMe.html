          <p> 
           When I graduate from my 4-year college, I plan to work in an IT company that involves in software engineering, preferably Workday, 
           as it possesses all the features I am looking for in a company. I am determined to make our electronics that we use everyday more efficient
           and accessible to everyone in our society. I plan to take computer science and engineering electives throughout my high school career and I
           plan to go to my 4-year college as a major in computer science. I am interested in this field because I am interested in electronics and 
           determined to make the world a better place using my extensive knowledge of coding. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
           	I am a perfect fit to your company because I am cooperative, knowledgeable, and self-motivated on everything I do. I will easily be able to
           	communicate with my colleagues effectively and cooperate with them to reach a reasonable solution. I am very low-tempered and I do not get 
           	angry or frustrated, which helps me be focused and efficient on my assigned task. I am also very knowledgeable in my field and this allows 
           	me to assist other people who need help. Using this knowledge, I am able to finish my assigned task quickly and efficiently. I also am very 
           	self-motivated to complete tasks and I will not give up until my task is finished. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
           I am in Algebra II with trigonometry, which is 2-3 years ahead of the common core curriculum. I am also excelling in that class, maintaining 
           a grade above a 93% . I also participated in a statewide chess tournament and won first place out of 100+ people, which shows my dedication 
           and intelligence. This will help me later on in my life, where I have to think creatively and smartly, just like in chess. I also volunteered
           in a bike-building program, where we built bikes for people with low income on christmas. This shows my kind nature, as I was willing to 
           sacrifice my free time to help those in need.
          </p>
          
          <p>
           Thank you for your time. I hope to hear from you soon.
