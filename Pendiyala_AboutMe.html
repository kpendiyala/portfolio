          <p> 
           My name is Kaushik Pendiyala and I am currently a 9th grader attending Dublin High School. As a gamer from a young age, I emerged myself with various
           video games that captured my interests. Soon after I started playing, I was intrigued by how this virtual world was built, as it flawlessly flowed together
           to create a game that I was addicted to. After further analyze this topic, I got introduced to coding and the different languages in it. Even though my 
           parents were programmers, this experience gave me a new perspective on computer science, as I was more determined than ever to create a game of my own. 
           To pursue this goal, I plan to take computer science and engineering electives throughout my high school, starting from 9th grade. I also plan to graduate
           my 4-year college as a major in computer science. I am interested in this field because of my passion for video games and my determination to make the world
           a better place by using my knowledge of coding.

          
          <p>
           I am cooperative, knowledgeable, self-motivated, and a leader. I can easily communicate with my peers effectively and cooperate with them to reach a
           reasonable solution. I am very low-tempered and I do not get angry or frustrated, which helps me be focused and efficient on my assigned task. I am also
           very knowledgeable in my field and this allows me to assist other people who need help. Using this knowledge, I am able to finish my assigned task quickly
           and efficiently. I also am very self-motivated to complete my task and I am able to problem solve very effectively. In addition, I am a leader and I take 
           account of other people’s opinions, making sure everybody on my team contributes to the project or assigned task. I am willing to listen to other people’s 
           opinions and I try my best to incorporate these ideas into the project.

          </p>
          
          <p>
          I am in Algebra II with trigonometry, which is 2-3 years ahead of the common core curriculum. I am also excelling in that class, maintaining a grade above 
          a 93%. This class has taught me to problem solve and persevere through obstacles to achieve my goal. I also participated in a statewide chess tournament and
          won first place out of 100+ people, which shows my dedication and intelligence. This will help me later on in my life, where I have to think creatively and 
          smartly, just like in chess. I also volunteered in a bike-building program, where we built bikes for people with low income on christmas. This made me more 
          creative, as I had to find ways to build the bikes without the manual. It also made me more giving, as the feeling of helping people made me feel more
          thankful to what I have. It inspired me to help more often, giving me a chance to change lives.

          </p>

          Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy the rest of my portfolio.
